the ZEUS cloudGatherer fork of the g.raphael pie js code.
developed for use within the ZEUS cloudGatherer infrastructure UI, this code was forked from g.raphael code, the graphing/charting library based upon the Raphael javascript SVG library

this fork was created to allow deterministic coloring of the pie chart slices, which could then be kept consistent with elements outside of the chart itself (e.g. a slice representing a value which is shown in another chart or diagram can be made to be the same color)
